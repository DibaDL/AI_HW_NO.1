    "We don't know how it works because it is part of unconsciousness and we haven't thought about it. Computer vision  works completely differently than human vision. It relies on the computer’s neural network, called a “feed- forward” system, that allows the computer to perform some steps. Like receive an image, detect the image’s pixels, detect its edges and contours, analyze the entire object, make an “educated” guess about what the image is. Human vision depends on each person’s visual cortex, the area of the brain in which he or she creates an accurate and very vivid representation of objects in the world around him or her based on the relatively scant information that comes in through the retinas in his or her eyes. Computers can’t “see” in the way that we humans can. More importantly, computers don’t have the consciousness and emotions required to form conceptions and contexts about what they see in the way that we humans can. \n"
